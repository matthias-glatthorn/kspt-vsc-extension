# KSPT-VSC-Extension: Keystrokes Per Technology

An extension for Visual Studio Code that tracks keystrokes to provide insights into your coding activity across different technologies.

## How It Works

This extension analyzes text changes to distinguish between manual keystrokes and automated code insertions. It listens to the `vscode.workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument` event and applies the following heuristics:

*   **Manual Keystroke**: A change is identified as a manual keystroke if the length of the new text is exactly one character. This is the primary method for tracking typing effort.

*   **Automated Insertion**: A change is inferred to be an automated insertion (e.g., from an AI coding assistant or a code snippet) if the new text is longer than one character and does not match the content of the system clipboard.

These assumptions form the basis for how the extension differentiates between user-typed code and code generated by other tools.

## Debugging

To start the extension in debug mode, press `F5`. The debug output will be visible in the Debug Console of the Visual Studio Code instance you used to start the debugging session.
